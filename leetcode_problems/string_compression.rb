  def test_calc
    #Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
    #The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
    #Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
    #After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

    #Follow up:
    #Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?
    #
    #
    # Input: ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
    #Output: #Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
    #Explanation:
    #"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
